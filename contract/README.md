A Hardhat-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript bindings for smart contracts
- [Deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy): replicable deployments and easy testing
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): code linter
- [SolCoverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): code coverage
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter
- [DocsGen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen): docs generator

## Getting Started

Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-template/generate) button at the top of the page to
create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Features

This template builds upon the frameworks and libraries mentioned above, so for details about their specific features, please consult their respective documentations.

For example, for Hardhat, you can refer to the [Hardhat Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) and the [Hardhat
Docs](https://hardhat.org/docs). You might be in particular interested in reading the [Testing Contracts](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts) section.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhintignore
├── .solhint.json
├── .npmrc
└── hardhat.config.ts
```

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that to make this work, you must se your `INFURA_API_KEY` and your `MNEMONIC` as GitHub secrets.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an environment
variable. You can follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, you can use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

### Build

Compile & Build the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ pnpm build
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ pnpm typechain
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ pnpm lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ pnpm lint:ts
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ pnpm test
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ pnpm coverage
```

### Generate Docs

Generate docs for smart contracts:

```sh
$ pnpm docgen
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ pnpm report-gas
```

### Up Localnet

Startup local network:

```sh
$ pnpm localnet
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to default network (Hardhat):

```sh
$ pnpm run deploy
```

For specific network, we need to add `network` flag

```sh
$ pnpm run deploy --network <network-name>
```

### Export

Export the contract deployed to a file with a simple format containing only contract addresses and abi:

```sh
$ pnpm export <filepath> --network <network-name>
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ pnpm clean
```

## Tips

### Command-line completion

If you want more flexible over the existing scripts in the template, but tired to typing `npx hardhat` all the time and lazy to remember all the commands. Let's try this [hardhat-completion](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/command-line-completion#command-line-completion) packages.

Instead of typing `npx hardhat`, use `hh` then tab to see available commands.

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the [hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.

## Using GitPod

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open-source developer platform for remote development.

To view the coverage report generated by `pnpm coverage`, just click `Go Live` from the status bar to turn the server on/off.
